**This is a work in progress**

These are drop-in libraries for adding an API endpoint to a flamework
project. There is currently no support for register(ed/ing) API keys or
delegated authentication.

It also assumes that you are using a current version of [my fork of flamework](https://github.com/straup/flamework):

Start with [bin/setup.sh](https://github.com/straup/flamework-api/tree/master/bin/setup.sh)
